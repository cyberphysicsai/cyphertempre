# Cypher Tempre Timechain Self-Model

**Runtime label:** Codex skill version.

This is the Codex bundle for Cypher Tempre: a persistent, verifiable,
self-healing cognitive self-model for an AI agent. It is stdlib-only Python,
includes `agents/openai.yaml` UI metadata, and ships without generated memory
state.

## Install

Copy this folder into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
cp -R cypher-tempre-self-model ~/.codex/skills/
```

Restart or refresh Codex so the skill list updates. Initialize a fresh chain
inside the copied bundle:

```bash
python3 timechain.py init --name Codex
python3 selftest.py
```

Or ask Codex to install it from the repository source ZIP:

```text
Install the Codex skill from this repository:

https://github.com/cyberphysicsai/cypher-tempre-genesis/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Use only this folder from the ZIP:
skills/codex/cypher-tempre-self-model

Copy that folder into my Codex skills directory as cypher-tempre-self-model, then run python3 selftest.py inside it to verify the install.
```

See `SKILL.md` for the full per-turn protocol.
