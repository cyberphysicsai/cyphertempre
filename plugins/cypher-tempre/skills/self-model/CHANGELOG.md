# Changelog

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-01

First complete release. Nine mechanisms, one mandatory per-turn loop, stdlib-only.

### Added
- **Timechain** (`timechain.py`) — append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained Ring ledger; Genesis
  Block carrying the covenant; content-addressed **blockspace** for any file type; load-time
  verifier (tamper-evidence); proof-of-work nonce mining as a tunable "brightness" target;
  O(1) incremental-head sealing (no full reload per block).
- **Faculty registries** (`registry/`) — 84 modalities + 107 senses, generalized from the
  CODEX V3 archetypal framing into domain-agnostic cognitive functions; emergent Dream Cache.
- **PoQ Gate** (`poq.py`) — six-dimension conscience (coherence, relevance, novelty,
  consistency, depth, covenant); SEAL / REVISE / FORCE_UNCERTAINTY / REJECT; cites grounding
  rings; deterministic proxies with a model `external_scores` seam.
- **Cambium Engine** (`cambium.py`) — gap → sprout/fuse faculty → seal; promotion on recurrence.
- **Chronosynaptic Tree** (`chronosynaptic.py`) — single-pass, in-process parallel-self MCTS
  (no subagents); collapse to the highest-truth path.
- **Continuum** (`continuum.py`) — long-horizon tasking via bounded data-height blocks with a
  full state refresh per block; resume from one head; task-aware self-validation; self-label
  and optional self-embed at ingest.
- **Recall** (`recall.py`) — self-labeling + relevance retrieval; the model judges from the
  index; lexical pre-filter + embedding cosine; adaptive depth governed by dissonance.
- **Embeddings** (`embed.py`) — pluggable backend; stdlib hashing default; `st`/`openai`/`voyage`
  adapters.
- **Consensus** (`consensus.py`) — quorum-attested (HMAC, k-of-n) tamper-resistance; auto-attest
  on every seal.
- **Immune system** (`immune.py`) — screen → scan → lockdown → revert-style rollback to a clean
  blockheight → molt the wound into a learnable scar → auto-grow an antibody faculty.

### Validated
- Real-repo stress test on **Bitcoin Core v27.0**: ingested the full `src/` (1,219 files /
  283,682 LOC) into 3,546 bounded blocks in ~2s; scaled to 10,642 blocks at constant per-block
  cost (O(1) seal); instant recall; end-to-end "trace block validation" task recalled the
  validation path and sealed a grounded trace.
